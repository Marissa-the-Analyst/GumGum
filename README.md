# GumGum
I analyzed 113 different gums across 17 brands to figure out the most common flavoring of gum.

### Finished Product ###
Pop into a sticky mystery and look at the dashboard yourself [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/marissa.nash/viz/GumGum/Dashboard2)!

### Inspiration ###
I was walking into a Subway thinking about another dataset I was cooking up, and I thought about how cool a sankey chart would go for various flavors of things. Then I thought about how there could be some interesting explorations into the world of gum. It's seemingly straight forward with mint being the most common flavoring, but is there something we could be missing? Are there brands that perfer one set of flavor over another? I decided to dig into some data to find out!

### Programs Used ###
- Excel for Data Collecting and Cleaning
- Tableau for visualization

### Scope of Work ###
**Deliverables** <br>
- Clean dataset of gum flavors
- Dashboard with gum KPIs and detailed charts

### Goals ###
- Explore new chart styles!
- Expand on my story telling/dashboard skills

### Data Collection ###
I went to various gum manufacturer's websites and explored their flavors for their gum brands. I also used wikipedia to get further inspiration for different brands to include. Finally, at my local Walmart, I checked the candy aisle. I feel pretty confident I got most of the common South Eastern Big Name gum players. I know a controversial exclusion could be Tootsie Roll's Dubble Bubble but with only 1 true flavor, and their general obscurity (can you even buy a single one of these at a store?), I decided to exclude them. Then I narrowed the flavor profile down to the 5 most common flavors (sour, spice, fruit, mint, sweet). <br>

Fruit most certainly is the broadest category and its no suprise its the most popular because of that. I think its a common trend for brands to branch out into 1 or 2 or 5 fruity flavors. You gotta get pretty creative to make a spicey flavor, but not so much with fruit!

### Viz Design and Creation ###
Alright I know I said I was going to make a Sankey... but it looked terrible! I think I had too many brands represented to make a readable data story... I also tried a spiral tree but I thought the radar did a much better job doing the same thing. I took a lot more consideration into how I built this viz. I found building Top -> Down to be less finicky with resizing elements and managing containers. Using blank containers and layout borders to create more natural whitespace and nailing the background color really helped the flow of the dashboard. I selected the colors for each flavor early on using color pallete inspiration from Pinterest. Staying consistent with the coloring across the dashboard helped the user to get little extra knowledge here and there. Also I liked the emojis at the beginning of each chart. I think it helped separate each "thing" and not overwhelm the user with a bunch of data at once, but let me know what you think! <br>

Its funny I definitely keep catching myself working backwards in these data vizzes. I wanted fun new visuals so I came up with the radar chart first. Then I thought it would be fun to allow the user to sort by gum flavor using the gum's image. Then I thought I should create a list of flavors that only shows up when the user clicks on the gum filter. But that got pretty complicated and by the time I completed it, I wasn't enjoying how it looked. So I moved on to basic KPI and conclusion development instead, only revisiting the bottom half at the end to decide how to fill that space. Which is when I came up with the Bubble Balls that remind me of Gum Balls! Perfect for showcasing flavor profile distribution across individual brands and describing the flavors I collected from each brand. I'm very proud of that last addition! <br>

From titles, to subtitles, to font consistency, I'm really proud of the story telling in this one. I think it reads naturally and each chart provides value to the user. There still isn't a single potent story, but by adding leading titles instead of just basic ones, I was able to lead "the narrative" better. I also think I held on to "the plot" of the story better. By having the upper page be insights about the gum flavors as a whole, the orginal focus of the story, I didn't get too caught up in the brands. At one point, I thought about adding retail price for each flavor, but thought better of it. Adding that element would have distracted from the flavor story. 

### Reflection ###
It's super cool to see my data visualization skills get better. It's nice to put things I learn or read about online or in classes to practice! I definitely have a lot of exciting projects to work on/release this year and I couldn't be more excited! <br>

What would you do differently? What did you think? <br>

Thanks for following me on this journey as always :D!
